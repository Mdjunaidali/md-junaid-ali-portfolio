            <p>
              "Cloud services" refer to on-demand computing resources and services delivered over the internet. These services are typically provided by third-party providers who manage and maintain the underlying infrastructure, allowing businesses and individuals to access and utilize computing power, storage, and applications without the need for extensive on-premises hardware and infrastructure. Cloud services offer scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, as resources can be easily scaled up or down based on demand, and users only pay for what they consume. Common cloud services include infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). Cloud services have revolutionized the way organizations deploy and manage IT resources, enabling them to focus on their core business functions while leveraging the benefits of highly available and scalable computing resources.
